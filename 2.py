Luggage Bag for 7 Day trip

sightseeing, hiking, formal evening dinners

considerings :

-1. hiking will be done on the last day(to store the hiking shoes at the bottom)
0. formal evening dinner/bonfire will be held on the 2nd last evening.
1. the clothes are rolled packed to get less wrinkled.
2. the packings have done in layers from top to bottom in order of requirements
   ( the things needed on the first day should be on the top )
   hence the things needed on the last day must be kept first
3. so break it in 6 layers
